## Cookie Cutter
Cookiecutter allows us to create template steps that can then be edited. It standardizes projects and allows faster development by allowing engineers focus on what is important. We have created a template step in [pipeline-step-cookie](pipeline-step-cookie). To create a new step:
```sh
$ cookiecutter pipeline-step-cookie -o src
```
